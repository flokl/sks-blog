# SKS-Blog #
The goal of this project is to get an understanding of how microservices work and communicate with each other. Basically, the code builds a platform, where authors can publish blog posts of Austrian landmarks. User and landmark management is not the goal of this project. Therefore, they are handled as static entities.
### Server ###
The server was implemented with Java and Spring Boot with Apache Kafka as messaging system to facilitate the communication between server-side services.

### Client ###
Ionic helped us to create a responsive and fast web client.
